                            In this project, I made a simple implementations of sniffer, and then I serveied some papers and implemented a sample in JAVA for Trojan virus. During the project, I used monitoring software tools to verified the correctness, such like wireshark etc.
                            Another inspiration point is SQL injection for the this project. that was more helpful to me, because open API of security is a big issue, and I using that for my research at present. Oh, one more thing. This project is my first academic research project.

It is a base work for my data mining research. Because data always loading from the cloud network, so many document formation is XML schema in informational network. Thus I made firend with XML. I understanding the structure of the entire document. and done a program for Data Extraction from this XML data in this project. But the most important things, that program is base on MapReduce Architecture. During this project I learned distributed computing & cloud computing how that work, and what to do for solving problems now.

At this stage, more and more data generator, such like the end user for social network service (like facebook, twitter and youtube etc.). But we didn't to analyse user action, that has been much more papers to support. So we studied the user, what that talking about the most popular things and top issues. and I coded program to parser PDF file to text via JAVA language. And I servey paper about ICT development trend during this project.

The project was my favorite project, because of I have got potential rules for the Taiwan visitors no web browse patten from the project, and then I got my research direction of my graduate student life. In Taiwan cases, Chinese people like to go shopping in the night markets. Japanese people like scene or view in Taiwan. And local Taiwanese like to go seasonal activities. The above information is that data told to me.

During the project, I programed java code to modify the originally parallel process on MapReduce architecture, and connected MSSQL Server for Dumping data to HBase on HDFS.
